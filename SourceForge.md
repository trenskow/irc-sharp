# Introduction #

This project has been migrated from a previous SourceForge project.


# Details #

Check out the project and the CVS repository at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/irccontrol .

There is also a even earlier version available at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/inter-net (yes, I know the name is weird, but at the time my idea was of making a complete suite of Internet protocol libraries).

Both projects will be available some time yet, as it holds the previous versions in the releases and CVS sections.
